name: microservices-reference-infra-basic
version: 0.2.14
description: "A bundle to deliver the basic infrastructure portion of the Microsoft Patterns & Practices Microservices Reference Implementation located at https://github.com/mspnp/microservices-reference-implementation . Full documentation for this implementation can be read at https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/microservices/. This bundle installs the basic infrastructure to host the applications, but does not install the applications. NOTE: You may need more than Contributor scope on your Service Principal, but it depends upon your specific tenant and subscription permissions. The source for this bundle is located at https://github.com/squillace/microservices-reference-implementation."
